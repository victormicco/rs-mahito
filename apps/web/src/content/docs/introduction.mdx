**rs-mahito** is a Windows CLI tool for removing metadata from files on NTFS filesystems. It clears privacy-sensitive information like Zone.Identifier streams, file timestamps, Office document properties, and file ownership.

## Features

- **Zone Identifier Removal**: Clears the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream that marks files as downloaded from the internet
- **Timestamp Reset**: Resets file timestamps to January 1, 2000, removing temporal metadata
- **Owner Clearing**: Removes file ownership information via SID manipulation
- **Office Document Cleaning**: Strips metadata from Office Open XML documents (docx, xlsx, pptx)
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire directories recursively
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them

## Why rs-mahito?

When you download files from the internet, Windows adds metadata that can reveal:

- When the file was downloaded
- Where it was downloaded from
- Who owns the file
- Document author information (for Office files)

rs-mahito helps you clean this metadata while preserving the actual file content.

<Callout type="info">
  rs-mahito is named after Mahito from Jujutsu Kaisen, whose ability to manipulate souls mirrors how this tool manipulates file metadata.
